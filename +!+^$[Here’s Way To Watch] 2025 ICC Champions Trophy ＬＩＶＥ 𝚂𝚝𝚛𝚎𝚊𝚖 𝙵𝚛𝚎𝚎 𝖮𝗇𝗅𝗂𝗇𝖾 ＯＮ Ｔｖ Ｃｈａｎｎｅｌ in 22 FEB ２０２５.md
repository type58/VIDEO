Recent Form
England enters this match in poor form, having lost their last four series against West Indies, Australia, and India. Their batting lineup will face a significant challenge against Australia's bowling attack, particularly in Asian conditions where England has historically struggled with a record of 76 wins and 88 losses.

How to Watch
The match will air live on Willow TV starting at 4:00 AM ET. The day-night contest begins at 2:00 PM local time in Lahore, with the first session running from 2:00-5:30 PM followed by a 40-minute interval.

Tournament Impact
This Group B clash is crucial for both teams' semifinal hopes. Only two teams from each group will advance to the knockout stage. England must improve their recent form to have any chance of progressing in a challenging group that also includes South Africa and Afghanistan.
